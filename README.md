# To-Do-list
My project is a simple web-application that manages your tasks each day.
you're able to add new tasks, delete tasks and once marked as complete they will dissapear so you have more room to add more tasks.

To use this, you type a task in the proper area and press add. Once the task is complete you can click the Complete button. If you don't want this task you can also click the Delete button.
